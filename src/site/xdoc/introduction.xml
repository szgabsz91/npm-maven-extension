        <section name="Introduction">
            <p>This is an experimental project that demonstrates an alternative way of downloading NPM packages during a Maven build.</p>

            <p>
                The most mainstream way of doing this would be to use [webjars](https://www.webjars.org/). This project contains another
                way that I don't recommend using in production, but had much fun implementing it.
            </p>

        <section name="Building Blocks">
            <p>The main building blocks are the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="npm-maven-extension">npm-maven-extension</a>:
                    downloads the NPM packages added to the pom.xml from an arbitrary NPM repository,
                    with or without authentication. The downloaded tar.gz file will be stored in the
                    local Maven repository.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="npm-maven-plugin">npm-maven-plugin</a>:
                    during the Maven build, the <em>extract</em> goal can extract the downloaded tar.gz
                    file into an arbitrary, configurable folder. The extracted resources can be referenced
                    by your client web application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/szgabsz91/npm-maven-extension/tree/master/demo" target="_blank">npm-maven-extension-demo</a>:
                    a Spring Boot demo application that contains a single HTML page that displays
                    a Bootstrap based welcome page. Bootstrap is downloaded using the custom extension.
                </li>
            </ul>
